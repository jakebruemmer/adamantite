<h1>Adamantite</h1>
<p>
  A local password manager written in Ruby. Passwords are encrypted and stored on your own
  computer without ever sharing your master password or stored information over the internet.
</p>
<p>
  You can use the gem by running the `adamantite` command in your terminal after downloading the gem. The window will appear on your screen (potentially not in the center of it, as that's a current limitation of the UI library it uses <a href='https://github.com/AndyObtiva/glimmer-dsl-libui'>Glimmer</a>. 
</p>
<p>
  Requires a valid license key to run. You can get one by <a href='https://buy.stripe.com/dR6g1e6wo8Z46acaEF'>visting this Stripe checkout page</a>. Once you complete the checkout, a license key will be emailed to the email address that you provide.
  
  This is currently a 1 time fee - i.e., a perpetual license, as I get this project more off the ground.
